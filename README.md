NeatNote
#Description
notes application, written in angular 17, with Ionic as style component framework (it can be used to transform the webapp in native app (ios/android).
It's a simple application, on the left we have the list of notes, and on the right the editable note selected.
We also got a sidebar menu, for switching from notes to trash (where the deletes notes awaits, ready to be permanently deleted).
There's no back-end integration, so when we reload the app, the originally notes reappear.
#Installation & Use
download or clone the project, and in the root directory execute:
npm install
to install the packages for the app.
Once is completed, run:
ionic serve
to see the app on localhost:8100
