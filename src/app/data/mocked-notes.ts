    { id: 'n1', excerpt: 'buy more books', fullContent: `buy more books.\nthose are some books to read in 2024, don't miss them out: \n------------------------------------------------------\nTommy Orange - Wandering Stars\nTommy Orange’s first novel “There There,” about a loosely connected group of Native Americans in modern-day Oakland, California, was a Pulitzer finalist. Now he’s back with a sequel featuring some of the same characters, several of whom are grappling with the effects of a mass shooting. Orange connects the story to the 1864 Sand Creek Massacre in Colorado, where more than 200 of their ancestors were killed, to reinforce the bloody history of persecution of Native Americans.
------------------------------------------------------\nPercival Everett -  James\nIt’s such a clever idea you wonder why nobody has done it before: A reimagining of Mark Twain’s “Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,” told from the perspective of Jim, Huck’s companion who escaped enslavement. The publisher promises that Everett’s novel, which like the original chronicles Huck and Jim’s journey on a raft down the Mississippi, will show Jim’s “agency, intelligence and compassion … in a radically new light.”
------------------------------------------------------\nJulia Phillips - Bear\nPhillips dazzled readers with 2019’s “Disappearing Earth,” her award-winning novel about a community grieving over two missing girls on Russia’s wintry Kamchatka Peninsula. Now she’s back with another story about two sisters in a remote setting — this time, on an island near Seattle — whose encounters in the wild with a massive, mysterious bear threaten to upend their lives and split them apart.
------------------------------------------------------\nAlison Espach - The Wedding People\nPhoebe Stone checks into a fancy seaside hotel at maybe the lowest point in her life, wearing her best dress and hoping for a few hours of pampered luxury before ending it all. But she soon finds herself swept up in a chaotic wedding, being mistaken for a wedding guest and befriending the bride — all of which leads her, unexpectedly, toward a possibly brighter future. This novel promises more of Espach’s trademark wit and knack for broken characters who, between the tears, somehow find glimmers of hope.
------------------------------------------------------\nCharles Duhigg - Supercommunicators\nWe’ve all probably wished at one time or another that we could be more persuasive. Duhigg follows his bestselling “The Power of Habit” with this examination of why some people are able to make themselves heard — and to hear others — so effortlessly. The book promises to show “how we can all learn to identify and leverage the hidden layers that lurk beneath every conversation.`, created: '01 01 2024, 06:00', modified: '', words: 377, characters: 2681 },

A card can be a single component, but is often made up of a header, title, subtitle, and content. Cards are broken up into several components to accommodate this structure: card header, card title, card subtitle, and card content.`,

    { id: 'n6', excerpt: 'Movies to watch in 2024', fullContent: `Movies to watch in 2024\nIn all fairness to the movie studios whose 2024 slates are a mystifying assembly of undated, untitled mystery projects, it’s increasingly difficult to guess what’s going to happen next week, let alone next November. It’s profound humility in the face of an uncertain world, surely, that explains the presence of “Untitled Alien Event Movie” and “Untitled Venom Sequel” on the calendar. Are these teases or threats? You decide. Anyway, this is to explain why the preview below may look sparse in terms of hard-and-fast release dates. There are still plenty of locked-in 2024 films to look forward to — Bong Joon Ho’s first since his Best Picture winner Parasite, the second half of Denis Villeneuve’s desert space epic, Dune, and Luca Guadagnino’s saucy tennis drama, Challengers, for a start. Elsewhere, we’ve got Joel Coen’s solo directorial debut, George Miller’s Mad Max: Fury Road prequel, and at least one Vulture senior writer’s “most anticipated work of art since the Obama years” (her words), a.k.a. Wicked: Part One.`,
